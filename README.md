# MyRobot

We have our good friend Robot Johny who got lost on the playground. His position is
represented by two integer coordinates: `X` and `Y`. X is the horizontal axis and Y-axis is
vertical.(Remember how you drew them in school?) Unfortunately he has some unknown random
initial position and we don't even know initial Direction. But he really wants to go home,
which is represented by `toX` and `toY`. Hopefully you can figure something out.
